# covid_impact_on_manhattan_real_estate

As Covid-19 loomed on, the cityscapes we once knew transformed into vacant habitats. The commotions from the hustle and bustle of city folks commuting to work were no more. 

For New York City, the extensions of lockdown prompted an exodus to the outskirts. Fears of the transmissions of virus within tight places meant desires for space and open air. Real estates in the countrysides and suburbs bloomed. 

If outskirts were thriving in real estate sales, what does this mean for the city? I gathered data for the 2020 rolling sales for Manhattan real estate properties to find out. 

I wanted to see if the pandemic did indeed make an impact. So I compared the 2020 data with another period's. I randomly chose 2017 because that seemed like a regular enough year. 

Performing a t-test with SciPy, I ascertained that the two years did indeed differ in their means. I could therefore REJECT the null hypothesis that there was no effect.
